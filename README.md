# blog
A homebrew blog software, you could use too

## premise
Two applications, one lightweighted angular ui for the blog that read static data (json), and one for writing the blog, with an ui written in angular and a backend written in Go. Indeed the Go application embedds the angular ui, so you need just one executable for your blog.
